# DegenToken Smart Contract

The DegenToken smart contract is an ERC20 token implementation with additional functionalities for minting, transferring, redeeming, and burning tokens. It also allows the creation of game items.

## Features

- **Minting Tokens**: The contract owner can mint new tokens and distribute them to specific addresses.
- **Transferring Tokens**: Token holders can transfer tokens to other addresses.
- **Redeeming Tokens**: Token holders can redeem tokens for specific game items.
- **Checking Token Balance**: Token holders can check their token balances.
- **Burning Tokens**: Token holders can burn their tokens to reduce the total token supply.
- **Creating Game Items**: The contract owner can create game items associated with specific token amounts.

## Contract Details

- **Token Name**: Degen
- **Token Symbol**: DGN

## Usage

1. **Deploy the Contract**: Deploy the `DegenToken` smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain.
2. **Mint Tokens**: As the contract owner, use the `mint` function to mint new tokens and distribute them to specific addresses.
3. **Transfer Tokens**: Token holders can transfer tokens to other addresses using the `transfer` function.
4. **Redeem Tokens**: Token holders can redeem tokens for specific game items using the `redeemToken` function.
5. **Check Token Balance**: Token holders can check their token balance using the `balanceOf` function.
6. **Burn Tokens**: Token holders can burn their tokens using the `burn` function.
7. **Create Game Items**: The contract owner can create game items associated with specific token amounts using the `createGameItems` function.

## Functions

- **mint(address to, uint256 amount)**: Mint `_amount` tokens and send them to `_to`. Only the contract owner can perform this action.
- **transfer(address to, uint256 value)**: Transfer `_value` tokens to `_to` from the sender's balance.
- **redeemToken(uint8 _itemID)**: Redeem tokens for a specific game item identified by `_itemID`.
- **balanceOf(address account)**: Check the balance of tokens for a given `_account`.
- **burn(uint amount)**: Burn `_amount` tokens from the sender's balance.
- **createGameItems(string name, uint256 amount)**: Create game items with the specified `_name` and `_amount`. Only the contract owner can perform this action.

## Modifiers

- **onlyOwner**: Restricts access to functions only to the contract owner.

## Error Handling

- **NotOwner**: Indicates that only the contract owner can perform a specific action.
- **InsufficientBalance**: Indicates that the sender has an insufficient token balance.
- **ItemNotFound**: Indicates that the requested game item does not exist.
